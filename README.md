# Lab 8 - Starterr


# 1
I will choose 1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Because this ensures a continuous a CI/CD development for my project.
And this will also allow me and my other team members to be at the same pace to see where is  the bug and where need more work on.
My teammataes will see the test result in the Github action workflow. 

The reason not choose the second one is that sometimes we might forget to run the test before we push the code.
And manually running all the test might be time consuming and unefficient

The reason not choose the third one is that there are some potential bugs and problems that will affect the development of the project in the future.
And it is hard to trace where the bug is if the project is at the end since there will be many lines of codes.

# 2
No

# 3
No I will not use unit testing to test message feature because this function is a very complicated feature and it likely involves many units. Since unit testing is used to test individual component, it is hard to test the entire message application. 

# 4
Yes I will use unit testing to test this feature since this feature only has one function that detect if the user typed in more than 80 characters. This can be achievede by a function so it is a single unit, and therefore we can use unit testing.
